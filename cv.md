### About me

After graduating from MGIMO university I started my career as a finance manager in a multinational company. Then I proceeded to a private network of medical laboratories, where I stayed for a couple of years as a Finance Director. 
Afterwards I changed my career path and studied at the Russian university of theatrical art - GITIS. From 2014 I am a chorus singer in the Bolshoi theatre in Moscow. 
Now I am up to a new career change and got interested in programming. I learnt about RSschool in one telegram blog and enrolled to the JS-FE stage 0 course.
